## Motivation :

In the [previous post](https://ethiy.github.io/2016/12/27/CGAL/), I explained how to build CGAL on Windows using MinGW. Using MinGW, I was deploring the lack of a good package manager for Minimalist GNU. Another reason was the fact that I needed QT5 (to build `CGAL_QT5` target) that is [not suitable for MinGW](https://wiki.qt.io/MinGW). Fortunately, there is MSYS2. You can get more details about this project from their [wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/Home/). Thus, in this post, I will show how to install MSYS2 and use MinGW w64 to install CGAL.

## MSYS2 :

I will not cover the history nor the motivations for this projects. You could do so on the team's official [website](https://msys2.github.io). Instead, I will adress the installation instructions. You need to follow these [instructions](https://msys2.github.io): they are self-explanatory. If you need to learn more about `pacman` you can do so on this [wiki](https://sourceforge.net/p/msys2/wiki/MSYS2%20installation/). Regarding the silent installation, I did not have enough time to understand how it should be done.

## CGAL :

CGAL is already available in `pacman` repositories. It is however not provided with QT5 dependecy. If this is enough for your needs then the installation would be a matter of minutes if not seconds:

```shell
pacman -Syu pacman # This will update pacman
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cgal # I recommend to use MinGW w64
```

If you prefer otherwise to build CGAL you need to install some tools:

```shell
pacman -Syu pacman
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain # Gets basic development tools
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-{boost,cmake,qt5}
```

You need now to download CGAL `release-4.9` and build CGAL as follows:

```shell
MSYSTEM=MINGW64 . /etc/profile # Or open mingw64.exe instead of msys2.exe

cd "C:\Path\to\CGAL"
mkdir build
cd build

cmake -G"Unix MakeFiles" ..
make -j4 all
make -j4 install
make install_FindCGAL
```
