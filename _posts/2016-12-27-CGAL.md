&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Computational Geometry Algorithms Library (a.k.a. CGAL) is a C++ Library providing efficient algorithms for geometric computations. You can have more detailed informations at its [official Website](https://www.cgal.org).

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This guide was tested for [release 4.9](https://github.com/CGAL/cgal/releases/tag/releases%2FCGAL-4.9) on a windows 10 ( but should work also for Windows 7 , 8 and 8.1). I tried to apply the [instructions available already on the internet](http://www.cgal.org/download/windows.html#BuildingCGAL), but it did not work for me as I wanted an installation for my project like the one you can get on Unix like operating systems. Indeed, You can, for instance, choose to ignore GMP and MPFR dependencies if you want to build CGAL on Visual Studio. Luckily, There is Minimalist GNU for Windows (MinGW). There is also Cygwin, but I was advised not to use it; which makes sense since you can get Linux on your Windows 10 now !!

Dependencies needed for this Guide:
